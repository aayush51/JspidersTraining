Q1] What is class & object
	<1> Class is blueprint for object 
	<2> Class is user defined non primitive datatype which represents blueprint of object 
		and provides all specification of object
	<3> Object is Block of memory which is created at runtime in heap area which is 
		representation of real world entity
	<4> Attributes/Details/Features/Properties of object are represented by non static 
		variables of class
	<5> Action/Behaviour are represented by non static methods

Q2] What is constructor and what is real use of constructor 
	<1> Constructor is special member of class whose name is same as class_name
	<2> It can only be used along with new operator
	<3> Constructor loads all non static members of class into object
	<4> Every class must have constructor , if programmer fails to add compiler add 
		default constructor

Q3] What constructor overloading and constructor chaining
	<1> Class having more than one constructor is known as constructor overloading
	<2> For constructor overloading constructor must change either in  its type or no of 
		formal arguments
	<3> Use of Constructor overlaoding - Customized laoding of values to object members
	<4>	One Constructor calling another constructor for execution is called as constructor 
		chaining
	<5> Constructor chaining can be done in two ways with 
		this() call - Constructor chaining within same class
		super() call - Constructor chaining within different classes with IS A relationship
 
Q4] In how many ways we can create object
	<1> Object can be created in 5 ways
		1) with new keyword
		2) with newInstance() method of constructor class
		3) with clone() method
		4) with serialization and deserialization
		5) with newInstance()

Q5] What are members of class
	<1> variables (static & non static)
	<2> methods (static & non static)
	<3> constructor
	<4> nested classes (static class & private class)
	<5> Initializers (static block & non static block)

Q6] What are differences between static and non-static
	________________________________________________________________________________________
		Aspect			Static							Non Static
	________________________________________________________________________________________
		Scope			1)Belongs to class itself		1)Belongs to instance of class
		No.Of Copies	2)Only one copy 				2)Each instance has its own copy
		Access			3)Accessed using the class 		3)Accessed through an instance of
							name							class
		Lifetime		4)Exist as long as the class	4)Exist as long as the instance 
							is loaded in memory				exists
	________________________________________________________________________________________
